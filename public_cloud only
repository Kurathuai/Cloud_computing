Deployment Strategies in Public Cloud
Public cloud services like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud provide multiple deployment strategies to optimize performance, scalability, 
Cost efficiency. Below are the primary deployment strategies:

Rolling Deployment
A rolling deployment updates instances in phases rather than all at once. This ensures that the application remains available during updates.

Key Features:

Updates a subset of instances at a time.
No downtime.
Requires a load balancer to distribute traffic.

Blue-Green Deployment
Blue-green deployment reduces downtime by running two identical environments:

Blue: Running version (old version).
Green: New version.

Once verified, traffic is switched to Green, and Blue is decommissioned.

Canary Deployment
A small percentage of users receive the new version before full deployment. 
If stable, the new version is rolled out to everyone.

A/B Testing Deployment
Similar to Canary, but specific user groups (e.g., based on geography or cookies) receive the new version.
Shadow Deployment
Traffic is copied from the live system to the new version to test performance before switching.
