Deployment Strategies on Public Cloud
Public cloud deployment strategies refer to the different methods and approaches used to deploy applications services 
Infrastructure on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud 
Here are the major deployment strategies:

Lift and Shift (Rehosting)
Also called Rehosting, this strategy involves moving applications to the cloud without modifying them.
This is the fastest and easiest way to migrate applications to the public cloud.

Refactoring (Re-architecting)
This strategy involves modifying the application to use cloud-native features.
Applications are redesigned to leverage cloud scalability, managed services, and microservices.

Replatforming (Lift, Tinker, and Shift)
Involves making some optimizations without fully re-architecting.
Example: Moving a database from on-premises to Amazon RDS.

Repurchasing
Replacing an existing system with a cloud-based SaaS solution.
Example: Moving from an on-premise CRM to Salesforce or Microsoft 365.

5. Hybrid Deployment (Cloud + On-premises)
A mix of on-premises and cloud infrastructure.
Example: Using AWS Direct Connect to link an on-premise data center to AWS.

Multi-Cloud Deployment
Deploying applications across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
Example: Hosting databases on AWS but using AI/ML services from Google Cloud.
