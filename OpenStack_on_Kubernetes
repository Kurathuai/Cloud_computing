Deploying OpenStack on Kubernetes: 
Strategies and Implementations
Deploying OpenStack on Kubernetes provides a containerized approach to managing cloud infrastructure. Kubernetes can manage OpenStack services as containerized workloads, improving scalability, portability, and maintainability.

Deployment Strategies

Several strategies exist for deploying OpenStack on Kubernetes, including:

Kolla-Kubernetes
Kolla provides production-ready Docker images for OpenStack services.
Kolla-Kubernetes was an earlier project that used Kubernetes to deploy these services, but it has been deprecated.

 OpenStack-Helm
OpenStack-Helm provides a collection of Helm charts to deploy OpenStack services on Kubernetes.
It allows flexibility and scalability, making it the most preferred approach.

Airship
Airship is a declarative system for deploying and managing OpenStack on Kubernetes.
It integrates tools like Metal3 for bare-metal provisioning and Helm for application lifecycle management.

 OpenStack on KubeVirt
KubeVirt enables running OpenStack VMs inside Kubernetes.
It is useful for hybrid environments requiring both containerized and virtualized workloads.
