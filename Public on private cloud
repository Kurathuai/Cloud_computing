Deployment Strategies of Public Cloud on Private Cloud
Deploying public cloud services on a private cloud is a crucial aspect of Hybrid Cloud or Multi-Cloud strategies.
This approach is useful when organizations want to leverage the scalability of public clouds while maintaining control and security in a private cloud.
Below are some key deployment strategies

Different deployment strategies for moving from public cloud to private cloud include:

Lift-and-Shift (Rehosting) → Simple migration without modifications.
Replatforming → Minor optimizations while migrating.
Refactoring → Rewriting apps to use private cloud-native services.
Hybrid Cloud Deployment → Using public and private clouds together.
Cloud Bursting → Expanding workloads to public cloud on-demand.
