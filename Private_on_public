Deployment Strategies of Private Cloud on Public Cloud
Deploying a private cloud on a public cloud is known as Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or Hybrid Cloud Deployment. 
This involves creating a logically isolated network within a public cloud provider, offering privacy, security
dedicated resources while leveraging public cloud scalability.

Deployment Strategies

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
A logically isolated section within a public cloud.
Provides private networking, custom IP addressing, and firewall rules.
Example: AWS VPC, Google Cloud VPC, Azure Virtual Network.

Hybrid Cloud
Combines on-premises private cloud and public cloud resources.
Secure connectivity via VPN or Direct Connect (AWS), ExpressRoute (Azure).
Example: A company keeps sensitive workloads on-premises but uses public cloud for scaling.

Dedicated Hosts/Instances
Uses physical servers dedicated to one organization within a public cloud.
Provides better compliance and security.

Bare Metal Cloud
Physical servers in the public cloud without a hypervisor.
Useful for workloads that require high performance without virtualization overhead.
